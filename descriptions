'The Thing Behind the Walls'

Main Hallway - "The gentle pitter-platter of falling condensation hitting cold stone stirs you from your sleep. The room is
  	cold...much too cold in fact. A door slams and a blast of air rushes across your bare face and your eyes snap
		open in horro. Who are you? Where are you? Your mind screams in the realization that you have no memory, no 
		anything. You blink into the darkness trying to adjust to the minimal lighting, and slowly the outline of the
		door that must have been shut appears. You struggle to your feet, every joint screaming in protest, and 
		trudge towards the door, your heart beat seeming louder with each step. You reach the door and push slowly, 
		and with a loud creak, you find yourself looking down dank, dripping hallway. The smell of mold invades your nostrils,
		souring your expression. You again wonder, where you are, or even who you are, terror rising in your throat.
		Summoning the stregth to carry on, you take small steps, investigating the 7 doors branching off the grim 
		grotto. The first door is labeled Dungeon, and you discover that it is from here the foul stench eminates. 
		Next to it is a door labeled Bedroom, and you notice it is opened just a small crack. On the other side of 
		hall are two more doors, the first labeled Kitchen, and the other, Library. Making your way past all these
		doors, you see at the end of the hall, a set of three doors side by side. Just the sight of the middle door
		causes your stomach to roll over, and upon closer inspection, you notice that it has a set of two key holes 
		in it. A loud bang from other side startles you, but once you've calmed down you take a look at the two 
		flanking doors. The one to the left seems to have scratch marks all over it, and the one to the right seems 
		to have a dark liquid fluid out from underneath it. The choice is yours, which room do you enter?"

Mainboss/

Miniboss1/Werewolf - "With a touch of your hand, the claw-marked door gives way. Peering in you are startled by a blast of
		      warm air to the face. Suddenly aware that you are not alone, you flick a match, and find yourself face 
		      face with a mangy coat of fur and a terrifying set of teeth. You're staring a werewolf in the face!
		      What do you do?!?"

Miniboss 2/Vampire - "Fighting your revulsion at the sight of what is now clearly seeping blood, you push the door inwards
		      and view the room inside. You see what seems to be a coffin in the middle of the room, and approach it
		      peering inside. You reel back in disgust as you lay eyes on the bloated and disgusting figure laying 
		      within. You your rising horror, the pale monstrosity sits up...and smiles at you. What do you do?!?"

Search Room 1/Dungeon - (Skeleton's hand, inside the cage, dark crevice in the stone) - 
		       "You open the door an a wall of stench hits you like a brick. Determined none-the-less, you begin
			down a long set of stairs. Upon reaching the landing, you peer into the gloom, and are taken agasht 
			by what you see. This was clearly used as a torture chamber, filled from wall to wall with terrible
			looking contraptions and sharp, terrifying instruments of indeterminate use. There seems to be three 
			places to of intrest; a decaying skeleton's hand, the back of a rusting torture cage, and a long 
			deep crevice in the back wall. Where do you search?"

Search Room 2/Bedroom - (Sheets, dresser, under bed) - 
		       "As the door creaks open, and you slink in as quietly as possible, it occurs to you that this room is
			spotless and clean...until you glance at the sheets and see that they are covered in blood. Mildly 
			disturbed, you glance around, and see two more places of intrest; under the bed itself, and inside
			an ornate and gothic dresser to the side. Where do you search, the sheets, the dresser, or under the
			bed?"

Search Room 3/Kitchen - (Knife drawer, pantry, in disposal) - 
			"The door grates open with a terrible screech, exposing a kitchen in total disarray. Half decayed food
			and other wet matter youd rather not guess about, coveres the floor with a sticky layer of film. 
			Silverware is strewn about, and all of the doors and drawers hang agape. Three places of intrest present
			themselves; the knife drawer, the pantry, and the liquid-filled sink. Wher do you search?"

Search Room 4/Library - (Bookshelf, desk, globe) - 
			"The door to the library opens efortlessly, exposing the winding stairs within. Taking them upwards, 
			you enter into a study, lined with bookshelves and curios. Three items catch you eye, a conspicuous 
			bookshelf, a desk, and a globe. Which do you search?"
